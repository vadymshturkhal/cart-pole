# üìù TODOs for CartPole N-step Q-learning Repo

- [ ] Compare NStepDQN with NStepDDQN;
- [ ] Test menu choosing models for correctness;
- [ ] Draggable indicator;
- [ ] Do it optional to print to console using menu training variant;
- [ ] Change config from menu;
- [ ] Add box with plot rewards after training choice;
- [ ] Autosave and save button for trained models;
- [ ] Save trained models with particular name, descriptions;
- [ ] Remain only off and human rendering modes;
- [ ] Add button for choosing training environment;
- [ ] Add quantity of episodes for Testing models;
- [ ] Add pause/continue buttons for Agent in training mode;
- [ ] Add Change resolution button with save to config;
- [ ] Integrate human render to GUI with plot replacement;
- [ ] Stop Training button must clear the plot;
- [ ] Test pre-trained model shouldn't open another window, it is better to show the test in another section instead;
- [ ] Add rewards section to description of a trained model;
- [ ] Standardise Agent's API;
- [ ] Update README.md;
- [ ] Get rid of train_menu;
- [ ] Add Model management panel;
- [ ] More visualizations like epsilon decay, loss or last N episode returns histogram;
- [ ] Add a log window to capture status messages and scroll through training history (episode rewards, averages);
- [ ] Decouple hyperparameters from launcher;
